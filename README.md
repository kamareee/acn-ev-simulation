# acn-ev-simulation

## Introduction
This repository contains EV fleet smart charging simulation. An EV fleet charging network like Caltech ACN is the primary model to build various fleet charing scenario and optimisation objectives.

## Running Environment 
Github CodeSpace and local

## Credits
Simulation models are adopted from Caltech ACN original repo: https://github.com/caltech-netlab/acnportal-experiments (https://github.com/zach401)
